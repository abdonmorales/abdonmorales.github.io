# CODE@TACC 2022 Summer Camp

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Data Interpretation**: Utilizes Pandas and Numpy for efficient data handling and analysis, processing temperature data from multiple CSV files.
- **Hardware Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Raspberry Piâ€™s GPIO interface, controlling LED outputs to reflect environmental data variations.
- **Adaptive Visualization**: Employs an algorithm to interpolate sensor readings, correlating them with specific LED patterns for an intuitive understanding of temperature changes.
- **Multi-Site Capability**: Versatile in handling data from various environmental sites, showcasing the program's adaptability to different data sets.
- **User-Friendly Interaction**: Ensures easy-to-understand visual feedback, making it suitable for educational purposes or for users with non-technical backgrounds.

## Technical Stack
Python, RPi.GPIO, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib.

## Application
Ideal for educational environments as a tool to demonstrate data visualization and hardware interaction, and can be adapted for practical environmental monitoring solutions.
